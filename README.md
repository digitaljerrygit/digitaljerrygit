### Product Designer. I enhance people via interfaces and functionality. No, I'm not trying to sell myself. I can do all these jobs as a specialist or as a generalist:

1. **User Interface Design:** (Themes, Design Systems, Visual Communication)
3. **User Experience Design:** (Identifying pain/motivations and introducing solutions or improvements. Advocates for the user)
4. **User Research:** (Recruiting, Conducting Tests, Designing Tests, Analysis etc.)
5. **Interaction Design:** (Mostly mistaken for animations or UX. Creating meaningful flows and interactions)
6. **Digital Marketing:** (Getting ideas to be seen where it needs to be seen)
7. **Visual Design:** (Aesthetics/Branding)

> _"People are instinctively curious: they want to learn, and they learn best by active self-directed exploration of
their environment. They like to have a sense of control over what they are doing, to see and understand the results of their own actions."_
